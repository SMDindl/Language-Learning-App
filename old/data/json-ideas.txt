Future possible ideas for json changes

Reusability of Tips: 
In the "questions" section, there's a "tip". 
If tips are commonly reused or could be shared across 
multiple questions, we might want to store them separately 
(e.g., as a reference or an array of tips) to avoid redundancy.

Future Translations Consideration:
If game becomes more complex or supports more languages, 
might want to introduce a section in the JSON to handle 
translations.
