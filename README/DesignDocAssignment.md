# Design Document Content Group Assignment


Create your teams git repository for your projects implementation.
Invite your professor and TAs as collaborators to the repository

- ReadMe file
    In your gits readme file, give a brief description of your project


- docs folder
Make a 'docs' folder, add the following (All documents must be named well, and easy to find):

	- Specification document

    	- UML Class Diagram... Make sure this is in pdf format, and it is optimized to 	fill the space, remember I will be printing it. All feedback and additions must be 	integrated.

   	- 2 UML Sequence Diagrams... Make sure theses are in pdf format, and optimized to 	fill the space. This must be very specific, and every method, considering every 	method that must be called. The methods and classes must match the UML Class 	Diagram


- json files

    Make a 'json' folder, add the json files required for this project. Each file has to have at least two objects in it (Unless it's the language).
    Make sure every field in the UML Class Diagram is stored in json, and vice versa


Comment:

    Leave a link in the blackboard submission, to any lucid chart diagrams, and make it so it's visible to anyone with the link.
