Project Implementation DUE SUNDAY: 

Need to implement "MissedQuestions" array within the progress tracker. 

Need to give each Question a unquie UUID so that we can just store these UUID's in the MissedQuestions array.

Need to create a method "public void storeMissedQuestion(String uuid)" in the ProgessTracker class.

Need to create a method "public void removeMissedQuestion(String uuid)" in the ProgessTracker class.

Need to create a method "public void storeMissedMatching(String uuid)" in the ProgessTracker class.

Need to create a method "public void removeMissedMatching(String uuid)" in the ProgessTracker class.

These methods will obvsly be used in game classes when user anwsers question.

Will need to create addional methods that act the same if we end up creating quesitons out of just words, such as matching questions.

Need to make sure the signup / login is properly ensuring that usernames arent taken and other validation nesseities are being met.

Steven needs github pro account before sunday.

Need to implement / use narrator somewhere

Hardcode UI to directly follow the Excellent Version of the scenario (obvs accounting for games vs lessons etc, but should follow the same flow.)

Implement logout in UI flow

Switch page numbers of book to String and make sure other cases of page numbers in the code match

This stuff should be added to scrum and there may be more.
